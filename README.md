> **:warning: Note:** To use this action, you must have access to the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) feature. GitHub Actions are currently only available in public beta. You can [apply for the GitHub Actions beta here](https://github.com/features/actions/signup/).

      -

        name: Choco help
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-chocolatey@master
