## ‚ú® About

GitHub Action as a wrapper for the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) CLI to build and publish packages. This will allow you to use Chocolatey on all [supported virtual environments](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#supported-virtual-environments-and-hardware-resources) available.

> **:warning: Note:** To use this action, you must have access to the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) feature. GitHub Actions are currently only available in public beta. You can [apply for the GitHub Actions beta here](https://github.com/features/actions/signup/).

## üöÄ Usage

```yaml
on: push

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      -
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      -
        name: Choco help
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-chocolatey@master
        with:
          args: -h
```

Docker :whale: image is also provided and automatically updated within [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crazymax/ghaction-chocolatey/tags) so you can directly use the [Docker Hub action](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-a-docker-hub-action) below.
This is the **recommended way to run this action in order to speed up the process**. :rocket:

```yaml
- name: Deploy
  if: success()
  uses: docker://crazymax/ghaction-chocolatey
  env:
    INPUT_ARGS: -h
```
